# hello-world
First GitHub repository.

My name is Sean and I am new to programming.  After doing some tutorials on Codecademy
FreeCodeCamp I decided to enroll at a local community college to pursue an AAS is mobile
app programming.  I'm going to start my third semester soon and have decided to create
a GitHub account to showcase some of my projects for any future prospective employers.

I am pretty new to programming, but at the moment I am interested mainly in object
oriented programming after taking classes in C# and Visual Basic.  I'm enrolled in a 
Java class this coming semester.
